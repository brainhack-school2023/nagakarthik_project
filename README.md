### About Me

Hello, I am Naga Karthik, a second-year PhD student at Polytechnique Montreal. My research broadly focuses on developing deep learning-based methods for medical image analysis. My current research project aims at designing novel methods for automatically segmenting lesions in traumatic spinal cord (SC) injury patients. During the first year of my PhD, I have worked on continual/lifelong learning methods for segmenting multiple sclerosis lesions in the brain.
